    Lakes are generally formed as a consequence of the tectonic or glacial activity in a typical region. 
    Lakes are also formed due to the meandering river or even by human activity. Lakes are quite important 
    for civilization, there are abundant reasons to point them out, this owes to the reason as lakes are a 
    resource of water, and water is a definite source to continue life on this planet earth.
    This lake is also facing numerous problems such as pollution, siltation, and encroachment due to urbanization 
    and climate change. The government and various organizations are taking steps to preserve these natural resources 
    by investing in research to understand the ecological balance, developing sustainable tourism, and educating the 
    local community for their conservation.
