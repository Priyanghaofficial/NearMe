A Garden is the best place in the house. As it is the only place where a person can get relief from a busy life. 
Moreover having a garden in the house welcomes many health benefits. For instance, a garden has many plants that give oxygen.
More than 310 tree species have been planted in the 25-acre arboretum, 5,500 specimens have been planted in the 10-acre conservation 
forest, and a TDEF plant nursery has been created, capable of producing 50,000 seedlings per year to promote the re-introduction of the
 indigenous flora of the region.</font>
