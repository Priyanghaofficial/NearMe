The temple's main deity is Lord Murugan, who is worshipped as the god of war and victory. The deity is depicted as a 
handsome young man riding a peacock with six faces and twelve arms. The idol is made of precious stones and is adorned 
with gold and diamonds. The temple architecture is a fine example of the Dravidian style of architecture. The temple has 
a tall gopuram (gateway tower) at the entrance, adorned with intricate carvings of various Hindu deities. The temple also 
has a mandapam (hall) with beautifully carved pillars, which houses the main shrine of Lord Murugan.</font>
